This benchmark contains 351 pairs of G6PD containing proteins (for a total of 26 proteins) 

Two ways to run the pipeline: 

```
bash commands.sh
```
  
or 

```
bash commands-steps.sh
```

to see the indiviudal steps of the pipeline.

To replicate the histograms found in Figure 6 of the paper, run the following script:

```
python hist.py
```

If you would like to see the protein embeddings and do not want to run the pipeline, you can download the embeddings as follows:

```
wget -r -np -nd https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/DCTprot/NPY
```
