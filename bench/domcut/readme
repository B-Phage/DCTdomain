This benchmark contains 2549 protein sequences used to test domain prediction performance by FUpred and RecCut on ESM-2 predicted contact maps. You can download the necessary contact map files with the following command:

```
wget -r -np -nd https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/DCTprot/CE/
```

Or if you would like to run the pipeline for RecCut yourself, you can run the following command:

```
bash commands.sh
```

If you would like to use FUpred instead of RecCut, you can download it from their link: https://zhanggroup.org/FUpred/download/FUpred.zip and simply call their binary file with any/all of the files located in the CE directory. Note that it will take much longer to run FUpred than RecCut for similar results.
