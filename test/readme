This folder includes a small number of proteins/protein pairs for testing purposes as shown in the README in the main folder.

Running the bash script below will run the pipeline on the proteins in this folder.

```
bash commands.sh
```

This will output example-dct.npz, which contains all of the DCT fingerprints of the proteins in example.fasta, as well two directories (NPY and CE) which contain the ESM-2 embeddings and contact maps for each protein. It will also output example-dctsim.txt which contains the similarity between each pair of proteins in example.pair. Given the homologous/nonhomologous labels in example.pair, we would expect homologous proteins to have high similarity scores and nonhomologous proteins to have low similarity scores, which indeed is observed in example-dctsim.txt.
